DESIGN DECISION: Familiarize user with Voice Panel as central ÆtherLight interface
WHY: Voice Panel is the main UI for all features - must understand it first

REASONING CHAIN:
1. User just installed ÆtherLight extension
2. Need to understand what features are available before using them
3. Voice Panel contains 6 tabs (Voice, Sprint, Chat, History, Patterns, Settings)
4. Sprint Tab shows this task list (meta: task displaying itself)
5. Exploration → Understanding → Effective usage

Context (CRITICAL - Include all of these):
- This is your first time using ÆtherLight
- Voice Panel is the main UI for all ÆtherLight features
- Sprint Tab reads from sprints/ACTIVE_SPRINT.toml (this file)
- Backtick hotkey is fastest way to access ÆtherLight

Steps:
1. Press backtick (`) key to open Voice Panel in VS Code sidebar
2. Explore each tab: Voice, Sprint, Chat, History, Patterns, Settings
3. Click on Sprint Tab to see this task list
4. Verify Voice Panel opens and displays correctly

Success criteria:
- Voice Panel opens when backtick pressed
- All 6 tabs are visible and clickable
- Sprint Tab shows this task (SETUP-001) ← You're looking at this right now!
- No console errors in VS Code Developer Tools

[tasks.SETUP-002]
id = "SETUP-002"
name = "Create Your First Real Task"
prompt = """
DESIGN DECISION: Learn by doing - create a task that solves a real problem in your project
WHY: Example tasks are fine for learning, but real value comes from using ÆtherLight on actual work

REASONING CHAIN:
1. You've explored Voice Panel and understand the interface
2. You've seen what a good task prompt looks like (SETUP-001)
3. Now apply that knowledge to your own project
4. Create a task with detailed prompt following the template
5. Let Claude execute it to see ÆtherLight in action

Context (CRITICAL):
- You now understand how tasks work in ACTIVE_SPRINT.toml
- Each task needs: id, name, prompt (with full context), status, priority, estimated_hours
- Prompts should include: tech stack, file paths, steps, success criteria
- Sprint Tab will show your new task once you save this file

Steps:
1. Think of a real task in your project (feature, bug fix, refactor)
2. Open sprints/ACTIVE_SPRINT.toml in editor
3. Add a new [tasks.YOUR-ID] section below SETUP-002
4. Write a detailed prompt following SETUP-001 example
5. Include: Context, Steps, Success criteria, Tech stack
6. Save file and refresh Sprint Tab to see it

Success criteria:
- New task appears in Sprint Tab
- Prompt includes all required context
- Task is specific enough that Claude could execute it without questions
- You feel confident the prompt has everything needed

Example task structure:
[tasks.FEAT-001]
id = "FEAT-001"
name = "Your task name here"
prompt = """
[Your detailed prompt here with context, steps, success criteria]
"""
status = "pending"

estimated_hours = 1.0
dependencies = ["SETUP-001"]

[tasks.SETUP-003]
id = "SETUP-003"
name = "Test Voice Capture (Optional)"
prompt = """
DESIGN DECISION: Optional voice testing - requires desktop app
WHY: Voice capture is powerful but requires separate desktop app install

REASONING CHAIN:
1. ÆtherLight supports voice input via Ctrl+` hotkey
2. Requires desktop app running in background (not installed by default)
3. If no desktop app: Skip this task, all other features work fine
4. If desktop app installed: Test voice capture to speed up workflow

Context (CRITICAL):
- Desktop app: Separate download from GitHub releases
- Runs in system tray (Mac/Windows)
- Uses OpenAI Whisper for transcription
- Hotkey: Ctrl+` (Control + backtick)
- Works with or without desktop app (voice is optional)

Steps (if desktop app installed):
1. Verify desktop app is running (check system tray)
2. Open Voice Panel (backtick key)
3. Click Voice Tab
4. Press Ctrl+` to start recording
5. Speak: "Create a function to validate email addresses"
6. Press Ctrl+` to stop recording
7. Wait for transcription to appear
8. Verify transcription is accurate

Steps (if NO desktop app):
1. Skip this task
2. ÆtherLight works perfectly without voice capture
3. Use Sprint Tab, typing in Chat Tab, all other features
4. Desktop app optional (for voice convenience)

Success criteria (if testing voice):
- Ctrl+` starts recording
- Microphone picks up voice
- Transcription appears in Voice Tab
- Transcription is accurate
- Can copy transcription to use as prompt

Success criteria (if skipping):
- Understand voice is optional
- Know how to install desktop app if wanted later
- Confident using ÆtherLight without voice
