# Event Pages Redesign - Implementation Summary

## âœ… Completed Implementation

All planned changes have been successfully implemented to redesign the events list and event details pages to match the motorrace.com.au reference design.

---

## ðŸ“‹ Changes Made

### 1. **Events List Page** (`src/app/events/page.js`)

**Simplified Design:**
- Removed complex card-based grid layout
- Implemented clean, simple list layout matching motorrace.com.au
- Each event displays:
  - Large, bold, red event title (uppercase)
  - Date with bold "DATE:" label
  - Track with bold "TRACK:" label
  - Single red "Event Details Â»" button
- Removed category badges, entry status indicators, and decorative elements
- Clean white background with simple border separators

---

### 2. **Event Details API** (`src/app/api/events/[id]/route.js`)

**Enhanced Data Extraction:**
- Added extraction of additional event metadata:
  - `promotor` / `promoter`
  - `permitNumber` / `permit_number`
  - `entriesOpenDate` / `entries_open_date`
  - `entriesCloseDate` / `entries_close_date`
  - `entryLink`
  - `eventStatus`
- Added comprehensive venue details object:
  - `name`, `address`, `suburb`, `state`, `postcode`
  - `phone`, `email`, `website`
- Added `categoriesWithEntries` array for grouped entry lists
- Added `sponsor` field to entry mapping
- All fields use fallback strategy (only included if present in API)

---

### 3. **Event Status Utility** (`src/utils/eventStatus.js`)

**New Utility Functions:**
- `calculateEventStatus(event)` - Determines current event status:
  - `entries-opening-soon` - Before entries open date
  - `entries-open` - Between open and close dates
  - `entries-closed` - After close date, before event
  - `event-live` - During event dates
  - `event-past` - After event ends
  - Uses API status if provided, otherwise calculates from dates
- `getStatusDisplay(status)` - Returns display info (message, color, icon)
- `getTimeRemaining(targetDate)` - Calculates countdown time remaining

---

### 4. **Countdown Timer Component** (`src/components/CountdownTimer.js`)

**Client Component Features:**
- Real-time countdown to entries opening
- Displays: Days, Hours, Minutes (Seconds when < 24 hours)
- Large, bold number displays with red/orange backgrounds
- Orange color scheme when less than 24 hours remaining
- "âš¡ Opening very soon!" pulse animation when < 24 hours
- Auto-updates every second
- Shows "Entries are now open!" when countdown reaches zero
- Optional callback when countdown completes

---

### 5. **Event Details Page** (`src/app/events/[id]/page.js`)

**Complete Redesign with Modular Sections:**

#### **Page Structure:**
- Removed old hero section, sticky sub-nav, and stats cards
- New clean page title section with red heading
- Alternating white/gray backgrounds for visual separation
- All sections conditionally rendered (only show if data exists)

#### **Section 1: Event Details** (Gray background)
- Displays: Promotor, Event Date, Permit Number, Entries Open, Entries Close
- Three-column grid layout (label | value)
- Only shows if at least one field has data

#### **Section 2: Track Information** (White background)
- Displays: Name, Full Address, Phone, Email, Website
- Clickable phone (tel:), email (mailto:), and website links
- Address combines street, suburb, state, postcode
- Only shows if venue data exists

#### **Section 3: Entry Status** (Gray background) - **Dynamic!**
- **Entries Opening Soon:** Countdown timer component
- **Entries Open:** Green badge + "Enter Now Â»" button (if entryLink available)
- **Entries Closed:** Red badge with X icon
- **Event Live:** Orange pulsing badge with live indicator + "come out and see us" message
- **Event Past:** Gray badge + "Thank you" message

#### **Section 4: Event Documents** (White background)
- Table format with zebra striping
- Single column: Document Name (clickable links)
- Alternating white/gray-50 row backgrounds
- Blue links with hover underline
- Only shows if documents exist

#### **Section 5: Entry Lists by Category** (Gray background)
- **Only shows if status is NOT "entries-opening-soon"**
- Grouped by category with separate tables
- Each category has:
  - Category name heading (large, bold, uppercase)
  - Table with columns: No., Driver/Team, Vehicle, Sponsor/Team
  - Zebra striping (white/gray-50 alternating rows)
  - Hover effect on rows

## ðŸŽ¨ Design Features

### **Typography:**
- Bold, uppercase headings in red (#DC2626)
- Clean, readable body text
- Consistent spacing and padding

### **Tables:**
- Zebra striping for readability (alternating white/neutral-50)
- Bold uppercase column headers
- Hover effects on entry list rows
- Responsive with horizontal scroll on mobile

### **Status Indicators:**
- Color-coded by status (green, red, orange, gray)
- Icons for visual clarity
- Animations for live events (pulse, ping)
- Large, prominent displays

### **Responsive Design:**
- Mobile-first approach
- Full-width sections on mobile
- Grid layouts collapse to single column
- Tables scroll horizontally on small screens
- Countdown timer adjusts (shows seconds only when < 24 hours)

---

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### **Data Flow:**
1. API fetches event data from RaceReady
2. `normalizeEvent()` extracts and structures all fields
3. Page calculates event status using utility function
4. Sections conditionally render based on data availability
5. Countdown timer updates in real-time (client component)

### **Graceful Degradation:**
- All sections check for data before rendering
- Missing fields don't break layout
- Fallback values where appropriate
- No errors if API fields are missing

### **Performance:**
- Server-side rendering for initial load
- Client-side countdown component for interactivity
- Efficient conditional rendering
- No unnecessary re-renders

---

## ðŸ“± Responsive Behavior

### **Desktop (â‰¥768px):**
- Two-column grids for event info sections
- Full-width tables with all columns visible
- Countdown displays all time units

### **Mobile (<768px):**
- Single-column layouts
- Stacked label/value pairs
- Horizontal scroll for tables
- Countdown shows fewer time units when appropriate
- Full-width buttons and status indicators

---

## ðŸ§ª Testing Recommendations

The implementation is complete and ready for testing. Test scenarios:

1. **Events List:**

   - Entries open (green badge + enter button)
   - Entries closed (red badge)
   - Event live (orange pulsing badge)
   - Event past (gray badge)

4. **Entry Lists:**
   - Multiple categories display separately
   - Zebra striping alternates correctly
   - Entries hidden when status is "entries-opening-soon"
   - Empty categories don't show

5. **Responsive:**

   - Tablet layout (768px, 1024px)
   - Desktop layout (1280px+)
   - Table horizontal scroll on mobile
   - Countdown timer responsive behavior

6. **Links and Interactions:**
