    "ExtremeTT is set to push the boundaries of track performance with official record attempts at three major Australian circuits. The initiative will showcase the extreme capabilities of the series' highly modified vehicles and demonstrate the pinnacle of grassroots motorsport engineering.",
    "The record attempts will take place at Wakefield Park, Winton Motor Raceway, and Queensland Raceway, with specially prepared vehicles targeting lap times that would challenge even professional racing categories. Each attempt will be conducted under strict timing and verification protocols.",
    "\"ExtremeTT has always been about pushing limits,\" said Series Director Marcus Johnson. \"These record attempts represent the ultimate expression of what our competitors and their machines can achieve when freed from traditional racing constraints.\"",
    "The vehicles attempting the records feature extensive aerodynamic modifications, lightweight construction, and highly tuned engines that produce significantly more power than standard racing categories allow. Safety remains paramount, with additional protective equipment and enhanced scrutineering procedures.",
    "Live streaming of the record attempts will be available, with professional timing and commentary providing detailed analysis of each run. The events are expected to generate significant interest from both motorsport enthusiasts and engineering communities."
