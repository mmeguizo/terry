    "Race Official is trialing an innovative digital flag system that promises to revolutionize race communication by providing more precise and immediate information to both competitors and track officials. The system represents a significant advancement in motorsport safety technology.",
    "The digital system uses trackside LED displays and in-car alerts to communicate flag conditions, sector-specific warnings, and detailed incident information. This technology enables more precise communication than traditional flag marshaling while maintaining the visual clarity that drivers rely on.",
    "\"Digital flag technology represents the future of race communication,\" explained Race Official Technical Director Dr. Sarah Park. \"The system provides unprecedented precision and reliability while maintaining the immediate visual communication that is crucial for driver safety.\"",
    "Initial trials have shown significant improvements in response times and communication clarity, particularly in challenging weather conditions where traditional flags may be difficult to see. The system also provides valuable data for post-race analysis and incident investigation.",
    "Following successful trials, the digital flag system will be implemented at select championship events throughout 2025, with broader rollout planned based on feedback from competitors and officials."
