    "The SuperTT championship is set to return to the legendary Mount Panorama circuit with its most competitive field yet, featuring 45 entries across multiple vehicle classes. This represents a 25% increase from the previous year's Bathurst round.",
    "The expanded grid includes new international entries from New Zealand and Japan, bringing fresh competition to the established Australian teams. Several former V8 Supercar drivers have also committed to the event, adding star power to an already impressive lineup.",
    "\"Bathurst is the jewel in our championship crown,\" said SuperTT Series Manager Tony Richards. \"Having such a strong field of entries validates the growth and appeal of our series. The racing is going to be absolutely spectacular.\"",
    "The weekend will feature two races - a 60-lap sprint race on Saturday and the traditional 161-lap endurance race on Sunday. Both races will be broadcast live across Australia and New Zealand, with international streaming also available.",
    "Practice sessions begin Friday morning, with qualifying scheduled for Saturday morning. The expanded grid has necessitated additional qualifying sessions to ensure all competitors get adequate track time on the challenging mountain circuit."
