Extensive testing has confirmed improved lap time consistency.",
    "\"The new tire specification will make our racing even more competitive,\" said MX5 Cup Technical Director James Rodriguez. \"By equalizing one of the most important performance variables, we're ensuring that driver skill becomes the primary differentiator between competitors.\"",
    "The tire change is part of a broader technical stability program designed to control costs while maintaining the close, exciting racing that has made MX5 Cup one of Australia's most popular one-make series. Teams have responded positively to the consistency improvements.",
    "All competitors will transition to the new tire specification at the start of the 2025 season, with comprehensive testing opportunities provided during the pre-season test days. The change is expected to produce even closer championship battles."
