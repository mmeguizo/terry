  "body": [
    "The SuperTT championship has introduced updated technical regulations designed to enhance performance while maintaining the competitive balance that has made the series so popular with teams and spectators alike.",
    "Key changes include revised aerodynamic packages, updated engine specifications, and new tire compounds that promise to deliver closer racing and more overtaking opportunities. The modifications have been developed through extensive consultation with teams and technical partners.",
    "\"These changes represent the evolution of SuperTT,\" explained Chief Technical Officer Mark Stevens. \"We've focused on maintaining our core philosophy of close, competitive racing while allowing teams to explore new technical solutions.\"",
    "The new regulations also introduce a success ballast system for championship leaders, ensuring that the title fight remains close throughout the season. This system has been successfully implemented in other international touring car championships.",
    "Teams have responded positively to the changes, with several announcing significant development programs for the 2025 season. The first test of the new regulations will come at the pre-season test day at Phillip Island next month."
