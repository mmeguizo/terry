# Production Build Error Fix

## Issue
The application was showing a "Racing App Error" in production build with the error:
```
Error: An error occurred in the Server Components render.
```

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. **Incorrect URL Construction in Production**
**File:** `src/app/events/[id]/page.js` (line 38)

**Problem:** The URL construction logic was failing in production when `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` was set to an absolute URL (e.g., `http://54.79.37.255:3001`).

**Old Code:**
```javascript
const url = `${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL || ""}/api/events/${encodeURIComponent(id)}`;
const finalUrl = url.startsWith("/") ? `http://localhost:3000${url}` : url || `http://localhost:3000/api/events/${id}`;
```

**Fixed Code:**
```javascript
// Build URL - handle both absolute and relative base URLs
const baseUrl = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL || process.env.SITE_DOMAIN || "";
const apiPath = `/api/events/${encodeURIComponent(id)}`;
const finalUrl = baseUrl ? `${baseUrl}${apiPath}` : apiPath;
```

### 2. **Excessive Debug Logging**
**Files:** 
- `src/app/events/[id]/page.js` (line 61)
- `src/app/api/events/[id]/route.js` (line 204)

**Problem:** Large console.log statements trying to stringify entire event objects could cause serialization issues in production, especially with circular references or non-serializable data.

**Removed:**
```javascript
// From page.js
console.log("[event-page] FULL EVENT DATA →", json.event);

// From route.js
console.log("[event-api] RAW RACEREADY RESPONSE →", JSON.stringify(json, null, 2));
```

## Changes Made

### `src/app/events/[id]/page.js`
1. ✅ Fixed URL construction to properly handle absolute base URLs
2. ✅ Removed debug log that could cause serialization issues
3. ✅ Kept essential logging for debugging (counts, status)

### `src/app/api/events/[id]/route.js`
1. ✅ Removed large JSON.stringify debug log
2. ✅ Kept essential logging for debugging (root keys, counts)

## Testing
After these changes:
- ✅ Build should complete successfully
- ✅ Production server should render event pages without errors
- ✅ All event data should display correctly
- ✅ API calls should work with both relative and absolute base URLs

## Deployment
1. Commit these changes
2. Rebuild the application: `npm run build`
3. Restart the production server
4. Verify event pages load correctly at: `http://54.79.37.255:3001/events/2025-round-2`

## Prevention
- Avoid logging entire objects in server components (especially in production)
- Always handle both absolute and relative URLs in fetch calls
- Use proper URL construction with environment variables
- Test production builds locally before deploying
