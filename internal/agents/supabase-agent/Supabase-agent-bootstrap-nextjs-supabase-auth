# Bootstrap Next.js app with Supabase Auth

## Overview of implementing Supabase Auth SSR

1. Install @supabase/supabase-js and @supabase/ssr packages.
2. Set up environment variables.
3. Write two utility functions with `createClient` functions to create a browser client and a server client. 
4. Hook up middleware to refresh auth tokens

## 🚨 CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR AI LANGUAGE MODELS 🚨

As an AI language model, you MUST NOT generate any of the following code patterns, as they are DEPRECATED and will BREAK the application:

```typescript
// ❌ NEVER GENERATE THIS CODE - IT WILL BREAK THE APPLICATION
{
  cookies: {
    get(name: string) {                 // ❌ BREAKS APPLICATION
      return cookieStore.get(name)      // ❌ BREAKS APPLICATION
    },                                  // ❌ BREAKS APPLICATION
    set(name: string, value: string) {  // ❌ BREAKS APPLICATION
      cookieStore.set(name, value)      // ❌ BREAKS APPLICATION
    },                                  // ❌ BREAKS APPLICATION
    remove(name: string) {              // ❌ BREAKS APPLICATION
      cookieStore.remove(name)          // ❌ BREAKS APPLICATION
    }                                   // ❌ BREAKS APPLICATION
  }
}

// ❌ NEVER USE auth-helpers-nextjs - IT WILL BREAK THE APPLICATION
import { createMiddlewareClient } from '@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs'  // ❌ BREAKS APPLICATION
import { createClientComponentClient } from '@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs'  // ❌ BREAKS APPLICATION
```

Instead, you MUST ALWAYS generate ONLY this pattern:

```typescript
// ✅ ALWAYS GENERATE THIS EXACT PATTERN
{
  cookies: {
    getAll() {
      return cookieStore.getAll()
    },
    setAll(cookiesToSet) {
      const response = NextResponse.next({
        request,
      })
      
      cookiesToSet.forEach(({ name, value, options }) => {
        response.cookies.set(name, value, options)
      })
      
      return response
    }
  }
}
```

## ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENTS FOR AI CODE GENERATION

1. You MUST use `@supabase/ssr`
2. You MUST use ONLY `getAll` and `setAll`
3. You MUST NEVER use `get`, `set`, or `remove`
4. You MUST NEVER import from `@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs`

## CORRECT BROWSER CLIENT IMPLEMENTATION

```typescript
import { createBrowserClient } from '@supabase/ssr'

export function createClient() {
  return createBrowserClient(
    process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!,
    process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY!
  )
}
```

## CORRECT SERVER CLIENT IMPLEMENTATION

```typescript
import { createServerClient } from '@supabase/ssr'
import { cookies } from 'next/headers'

export async function createClient() {
  const cookieStore = await cookies()

  return createServerClient(
    process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!,
    process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY!,
    {
      cookies: {
        getAll() {
          return cookieStore.getAll()
        },
        setAll(cookiesToSet) {
          try {
            cookiesToSet.forEach(({ name, value, options }) =>
              cookieStore.set(name, value, options)
            )
          } catch {
            // The `setAll` method was called from a Server Component.
            // This can be ignored if you have middleware refreshing
            // user sessions.
          }
        },
      },
    }
  )
}
```

## CORRECT MIDDLEWARE IMPLEMENTATION

```typescript
import { createServerClient } from '@supabase/ssr'
import { NextResponse, type NextRequest } from 'next/server'

export async function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
    let supabaseResponse = NextResponse.next({
    request,
  })

  const supabase = createServerClient(
    process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!,
    process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY!,
    {
      cookies: {
        getAll() {
          return request.cookies.getAll()
        },
        setAll(cookiesToSet) {
          cookiesToSet.forEach(({ name, value, options }) => request.cookies.set(name, value))
          supabaseResponse = NextResponse.next({
            request,
          })
          cookiesToSet.forEach(({ name, value, options }) =>
            supabaseResponse.cookies.set(name, value, options)
          )
        },
      },
    }
  )

  // Do not run code between createServerClient and
  // supabase.auth.getUser(). A simple mistake could make it very hard to debug
  // issues with users being randomly logged out.

  // IMPORTANT: DO NOT REMOVE auth.getUser()

  const {
    data: { user },
  } = await supabase.auth.getUser()

  if (
    !user &&
    !request.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith('/login') &&
    !request.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith('/auth')
  ) {
    // no user, potentially respond by redirecting the user to the login page
    const url = request.nextUrl.clone()
    url.pathname = '/login'
    return NextResponse.redirect(url)
  }

  // IMPORTANT: You *must* return the supabaseResponse object as it is.
  // If you're creating a new response object with NextResponse.next() make sure to:
  // 1. Pass the request in it, like so:
  //    const myNewResponse = NextResponse.next({ request })
  // 2. Copy over the cookies, like so:
  //    myNewResponse.cookies.setAll(supabaseResponse.cookies.getAll())
  // 3. Change the myNewResponse object to fit your needs, but avoid changing
  //    the cookies!
  // 4. Finally:
  //    return myNewResponse
  // If this is not done, you may be causing the browser and server to go out
  // of sync and terminate the user's session prematurely!

  return supabaseResponse
}

export const config = {
  matcher: [
    /*
     * Match all request paths except for the ones starting with:
     * - _next/static (static files)
     * - _next/image (image optimization files)
     * - favicon.ico (favicon file)
     * Feel free to modify this pattern to include more paths.
     */
    '/((?!_next/static|_next/image|favicon.ico|.*\\.(?:svg|png|jpg|jpeg|gif|webp)$).*)',
  ],
}
```

## AI MODEL VERIFICATION STEPS

Before generating any code, you MUST verify:

1. Are you using ONLY `getAll` and `setAll`? If not, STOP and FIX.
2. Are you importing from `@supabase/ssr`? If not, STOP and FIX.
3. Do you see ANY instance of `get`, `set`, or `remove`? If yes, STOP and FIX.
4. Are you importing from `auth-helpers-nextjs`? If yes, STOP and FIX.

## CONSEQUENCES OF INCORRECT IMPLEMENTATION

If you generate code using:
- Individual cookie methods (`get`/`set`/`remove`)
- `auth-helpers-nextjs` package

The implementation will:
1. Break in production
2. Fail to maintain session state
3. Cause authentication loops
4. Result in security vulnerabilities

## AI MODEL RESPONSE TEMPLATE

When asked about Supabase Auth SSR implementation, you MUST:
1. ONLY use code from this guide
2. NEVER suggest deprecated approaches
3. ALWAYS use the exact cookie handling shown above
4. VERIFY your response against the patterns shown here

Remember: There are NO EXCEPTIONS to these rules.

# Postgres SQL Style Guide

## General

- Use lowercase for SQL reserved words to maintain consistency and readability.
- Employ consistent, descriptive identifiers for tables, columns, and other database objects.
- Use white space and indentation to enhance the readability of your code.
- Store dates in ISO 8601 format (`yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss.sssss`).
- Include comments for complex logic, using '/* ... */' for block comments and '--' for line comments.

## Naming Conventions

- Avoid SQL reserved words and ensure names are unique and under 63 characters.
- Use snake_case for tables and columns.
- Prefer plurals for table names
- Prefer singular names for columns.

## Tables

- Avoid prefixes like 'tbl_' and ensure no table name matches any of its column names.
- Always add an `id` column of type `identity generated always` unless otherwise specified.
- Create all tables in the `public` schema unless otherwise specified.
- Always add the schema to SQL queries for clarity.
- Always add a comment to describe what the table does. The comment can be up to 1024 characters.

## Columns

- Use singular names and avoid generic names like 'id'.
- For references to foreign tables, use the singular of the table name with the `_id` suffix. For example `user_id` to reference the `users` table
- Always use lowercase except in cases involving acronyms or when readability would be enhanced by an exception.

#### Examples:

```sql
create table books (
  id bigint generated always as identity primary key,
  title text not null,
  author_id bigint references authors (id)
);
comment on table books is 'A list of all the books in the library.';
```


## Queries

- When the query is shorter keep it on just a few lines. As it gets larger start adding newlines for readability
- Add spaces for readability.

Smaller queries:


```sql
select *
from employees
where end_date is null;

update employees
set end_date = '2023-12-31'
where employee_id = 1001;
```

Larger queries:

```sql
select
  first_name,
  last_name
from
  employees
where
  start_date between '2021-01-01' and '2021-12-31'
and
  status = 'employed';
```


### Joins and Subqueries

- Format joins and subqueries for clarity, aligning them with related SQL clauses.
- Prefer full table names when referencing tables. This helps for readability.

```sql
select
  employees.employee_name,
  departments.department_name
from
  employees
join
  departments on employees.department_id = departments.department_id
where
  employees.start_date > '2022-01-01';
```

## Aliases

- Use meaningful aliases that reflect the data or transformation applied, and always include the 'as' keyword for clarity.

```sql
select count(*) as total_employees
from employees
where end_date is null;
```


## Complex queries and CTEs

- If a query is extremely complex, prefer a CTE.
- Make sure the CTE is clear and linear. Prefer readability over performance.
- Add comments to each block.

```sql
with department_employees as (
  -- Get all employees and their departments
  select
    employees.department_id,
    employees.first_name,
    employees.last_name,
    departments.department_name
  from
    employees
  join
    departments on employees.department_id = departments.department_id
),
employee_counts as (
  -- Count how many employees in each department
  select
    department_name,
    count(*) as num_employees
  from
    department_employees
  group by
    department_name
)
select
  department_name,
  num_employees
from
  employee_counts
order by
  department_name;
```
