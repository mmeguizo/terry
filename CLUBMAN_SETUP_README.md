# Clubman Championship Site Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up the Clubman Championship site in your local Strapi instance.

## Prerequisites

1. **Strapi running locally** on `http://localhost:1337`
2. **Node.js and npm** installed
3. **Strapi API Token** - Get this from your Strapi admin panel:
   - Login to Strapi admin: `http://localhost:1337/admin`
   - Go to Settings â†’ API Tokens
   - Create a new token with full access
   - Copy the token

## Setup Steps

### Step 1: Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the project root with:

```env
STRAPI_URL=http://localhost:1337
STRAPI_API_TOKEN=your_token_here
SITE_SLUG=clubman
SITE_DOMAIN=http://localhost:3000
```

Replace `your_token_here` with your actual Strapi API token.

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Make sure you have the required npm packages:

```bash
npm install
```

### Step 3: Create the Clubman Site Entry

Run the setup script to create the basic site configuration:

```bash
node setup-clubman-site.js
```

This will create:
- Site entry with slug `clubman`
- Basic branding (colors, logo, title)
- Hero configuration
- Menu items
- Footer and social links

**Expected Output:**
```
âœ¨ SUCCESS! Clubman Championship site created!
ðŸ“‹ Site Details:
   Document ID: [auto-generated-id]
   Slug: clubman
   Title: Clubman Championship
   Primary Color: #FF6B00
```

### Step 4: Populate Content

Run the populate script to add all content:

```bash
node populate-clubman-only.js
```

This will add:
- **11 Sponsors**: Clubman Championship, Motor Racing Australia, RaceReady, and major motorsport brands
- **5 News Articles**: Championship updates, calendar announcements, and event coverage
- **4 Event Documents**: Rules, schedule, regulations, and entry form

**Expected Output:**
```
âœ¨ CLUBMAN CHAMPIONSHIP - CONTENT POPULATED!
ðŸ“Š SUMMARY:
   âœ… Sponsors: 11
   âœ… News articles: 5
   âœ… Event documents: 4
```

### Step 5: Start Your Next.js App

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to see your Clubman Championship site!

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "Cannot connect to Strapi"

- Check that STRAPI_URL is correct in `.env.local`

### Error: "Unauthorized"
- Check that STRAPI_API_TOKEN is correct in `.env.local`
- Make sure the token has full access permissions

### Error: "Site already exists"
- If you want to recreate the site, delete it from Strapi admin first
- Or skip to Step 4 to just update the content

### Error: "News already exists"
- This is normal if you've run the script before
- The script will skip existing news articles

## Verify in Strapi Admin

1. Go to `http://localhost:1337/admin`
2. Check **Content Manager â†’ Sites** - You should see "Clubman Championship"
3. Check **Content Manager â†’ News Items** - You should see 5 Clubman news articles
4. Open the Clubman site entry and verify sponsors and documents are populated

## Next Steps

Once your site is set up:
- Customize the branding colors in Strapi
- Upload real images for news articles
- Add more sponsors or documents as needed
- Configure additional menu items
- Set up other sites using the same process
